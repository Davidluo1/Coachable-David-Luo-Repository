        Goal: Evaluate the given expression.

        Caution:
        There are empty spaces in the string

        Appraoch: Stack
        1. Push all the integer and operators in separate stack. Skip spaces.
        2. Calculate all the multiplication and divisions.

        [/]

        Appracoh:
        1. Check if the current index value is not an empty space.
        2. If it is an integer, get the full number and append it to a stack.
        3. If the operator is not empty, calculate the new sum and append to the stack.
        4. Get an operator variable that only stores division and multiplication.
